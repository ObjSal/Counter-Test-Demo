This project is to demonstrate how to run tests on solidity smart contracts.

```
$ npm install
$ truffle test
```

NOTE: Times will most likely be +100ms, these times are a concern when they are run on a real network such as an Ethereum mainnet.

Dependencies
* truffle-assertions (via npm install)
* npm
* node
